# This file lets you create shortcuts for running your test suite.
# The simplest use case for this would be when you have multiple environments (in the environments.yml file)
# then you might want to create different profiles for each environment as such:
# production: "ENVIRONMENT=Production -r features/support features"
# testing: "ENVIRONMENT=Testing -r features/support features"
# devb1: "ENVIRONMENT=DEVB1 -r features/support features"
# Then you can run your tests against those environments with commands like these:
# cucumber --profile testing
# cucumber --profile devb1
#
# For a full description of options available here check out: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/cucumber.yml
