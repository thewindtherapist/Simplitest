  <h1> CAF&Eacute;: Instructions</h1>
  <p> If you just installed CAF&Eacute; and haven't done this before, run <br/> <code> cafe setup </code> <br/>from the command line. </p>
  <p> This will generate a new folder called "setup" with instructions to add right click shortcuts and notepad features that come with CAF&Eacute; </p>
  <p> Here are some other commands you may find useful:
    <code> cafe run </code> #Runs your entire project. Must be executed from the root directory of the project (the directory that has the features folder in it) <br/>
    <code> cafe smoketest </code> #Only runs tests in the SmokeTest directory <br/>
    <code> cafe run path/to/feature/file </code> #Only runs the specified feature file <br/>
    <code> cafe run path/to/feature/file:line_number </code> #Only runs the scenario that starts at the provided line number <br/>
